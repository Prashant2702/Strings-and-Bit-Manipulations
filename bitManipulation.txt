...Bit Manipulation...
Get i
th bit:
Mask: Right shift n ‘i’ times, and check the first bit.

Set i
th bit:
Mask: 1 << i
Bitwise OR operation between n and mask sets the i

th bit to one.

Clear i
th bit
Mask: ~ (1 << i )
In the mask, all the bits would be one, except the i

th bit. Taking bitwise AND with n

would clear the i
th bit.

Toggle i
th bit
Mask: 1 << i
Bitwise XOR operation between n and mask toggle the i
th bit.

Update i’th bit to the given value
Mask: mask has all the bits set to one except i
th bit.

n = n & mask, i

th bit is cleared.

Now, to set i

th bit to value, we take value << pos as the mask.
