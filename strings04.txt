...Sorting a string... 
To sort a string, we need to include a header file known as
algorithm in our code like this
#include<algorithim>
Then we can use sort() function that is present in above header file on our string.
Sort() function takes 2 arguments viz. iterator to start of the string and iterator to
end of the string.
