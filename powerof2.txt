...To check a number as power of 2...
Count set bits
n & (n - 1) sets the first set-bit to zero.
Explanation: n = XXX100
n - 1 = XXX011
n & ( n - 1 ) = XXX000
Power of two
From our past knowledge of the binary number system,
Numbers of the type 2

n have only 1 set bit.

Explanation: n = 000100
n - 1 = 000011
n & ( n - 1 ) = 000000
!( n & ( n - 1 ) ) = 000001
If the number only had one set bit, then n & ( n - 1 ) would be zero.
